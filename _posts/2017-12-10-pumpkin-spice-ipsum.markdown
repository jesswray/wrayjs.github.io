New React project: [pumpkin spice lorem ipsum](http://jesswray.com/pumpkin-ipsum)!  Now all your filler text can be cozy. It was inspired by other funny ipsums I use: [Bacon Ipsum][bacon-ipsum], [Vegan Ipsum][vegan-ipsum], and [Hipster Ipsum][hipster-ipsum].

I built it this afternoon, which is exciting, because previously I thought when people "built things in an afternoon" they were lying.  Turns out repetition is key.  After deploying new React apps a few times, I am a veritable factory of widgets no one asked for.

The hardest part of this was coming up with a dictionary!  I had to limit the Latin I mixed in so it didn't overwhelm my limited mood words.  Still, the text can look repetitive.  (You can see that "knee socks" appear three times in the preview.)  I see text analysis on Buzzfeed articles about fall in my future.
